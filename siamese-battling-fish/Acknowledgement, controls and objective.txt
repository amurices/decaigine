ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
A lot of the rendering code; essentially most of the spriteBatch and GLSLprogram implementation, was based on
Ben Arnold's tutorial of how to mimic Microsoft's XNA's very SpriteBatch rendering class and make it speak to 
OpenGL. His tutorial included a rudimentary resource management class, which was adapted to effectively load and unload
game assets (audio and textures in this case).

Setup:
Downloading on a separate machine, a problem might come up; the solution does not open the ORGANIZE project at first.
To amend this:
1. Right-click the ORGANIZE(load failed) simple and select Reload Project
2. Right click the ORGANIZE now properly loaded project and select "Set as startup project"
And there, that should work.

Controls:
Press Space to jump the sword, left and right to move it, WASD to move the camera and E/Q to zoom in and out.
Make the sword jump to its children to win!
